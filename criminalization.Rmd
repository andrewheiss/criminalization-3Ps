TODO: 

- Does criminalization mean just paper compliance or is there something there?
- Partial vs. full criminalization
- Figure 6.8 from the book - look at two of the three Ps (not prosecution) as DVs in Choâ€™s models
- Also code if countries have an action plan or not - that might matter too - control for US effort (not the TIP score, but other measures of aid, like Wikileaks, USAID, number of trafficking NGOs in the country, etc.)

## Run models
